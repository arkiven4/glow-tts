/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p323/p323_297.wav|34|I've got the shirt.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p297/p297_402.wav|42|I don't have a problem with getting older.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p267/p267_182.wav|0|A team is a team.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p226/p226_121.wav|43|Maybe this battle has been.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p311/p311_226.wav|4|Gone with them is any sense of narrative.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p335/p335_279.wav|49|Or rather he did and he didn't.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p270/p270_068.wav|8|Then followed a bout of flu.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p260/p260_072.wav|81|It was magic.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p362/p362_341.wav|15|The result could be all down to turnout.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p228/p228_180.wav|57|One season, they might do well.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p316/p316_152.wav|85|Failure is not an option.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p317/p317_423.wav|97|Manchester United are the classic example.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p243/p243_292.wav|53|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p362/p362_054.wav|15|We certainly hope we have been successful.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p243/p243_305.wav|53|What happened in that game ?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p364/p364_297.wav|88|It was just one man.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p255/p255_049.wav|31|We were surprised to see the photograph.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p297/p297_358.wav|42|He said he had no reports of casualties.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p283/p283_430.wav|95|My aim is a top six finish.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p310/p310_300.wav|17|Mike Tyson went to prison.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p363/p363_051.wav|6|The nation has his music.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p261/p261_112.wav|100|It became a national network.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p234/p234_036.wav|3|It was sold at a loss.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p247/p247_470.wav|14|They were good years for him.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p303/p303_269.wav|44|After that nothing could save him.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p317/p317_256.wav|97|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p351/p351_161.wav|33|Paterson can afford to be generous.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p314/p314_295.wav|51|You take a risk.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p293/p293_268.wav|23|Our children are our future.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p306/p306_352.wav|12|Who has the second highest?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p273/p273_098.wav|56|The following are the principal provisions.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p285/p285_029.wav|2|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p266/p266_073.wav|20|It works for us.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p374/p374_288.wav|11|I had a good life at Rangers.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p280/p280_171.wav|52|You need a long-term strategy in football.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p239/p239_203.wav|48|It is all to do with the coaching.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p287/p287_292.wav|77|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p330/p330_112.wav|1|Wallace was in at the deep end.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p247/p247_141.wav|14|They made such decisions in London.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p277/p277_050.wav|89|This represents a tough game for us.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p233/p233_289.wav|84|He looked very sharp.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p284/p284_103.wav|16|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p334/p334_366.wav|38|We will miss him very much.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p238/p238_196.wav|37|Tiger is not the norm.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p304/p304_193.wav|72|Then they were awarded a penalty.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p229/p229_348.wav|67|Look at the witnesses.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p268/p268_147.wav|87|how do you get it back ?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p293/p293_348.wav|23|He quit in October.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p341/p341_082.wav|66|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p258/p258_097.wav|26|It is a good lifestyle.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p340/p340_220.wav|74|Not so, it seems.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p269/p269_174.wav|94|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p270/p270_078.wav|8|I've had it for the exams.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p334/p334_224.wav|38|I can't blame the fans.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p307/p307_306.wav|22|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p361/p361_205.wav|79|Translation - we got it wrong.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p229/p229_142.wav|67|What will happen then ?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p310/p310_221.wav|17|We will look into it.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p232/p232_357.wav|96|He had played well in that central role.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p263/p263_389.wav|39|This season has been a nightmare.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p283/p283_273.wav|95|Did he trip ?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p374/p374_277.wav|11|Where do you start?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p301/p301_289.wav|91|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p345/p345_267.wav|82|Her presence was almost everywhere.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p264/p264_226.wav|65|No partners would lose their jobs.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p253/p253_050.wav|70|A neighbour said.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p276/p276_118.wav|106|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p295/p295_175.wav|92|Anything that can be done, the Government will do.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p247/p247_466.wav|14|I think it's a great system.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p301/p301_182.wav|91|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p294/p294_156.wav|104|We are well insured.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p287/p287_190.wav|77|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p258/p258_333.wav|26|Robert is a special talent.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p275/p275_122.wav|40|Who would have?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p231/p231_259.wav|50|It was the climax of the thing.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p330/p330_073.wav|1|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p277/p277_239.wav|89|I should think so, too.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p374/p374_352.wav|11|As if they ever stopped.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p244/p244_258.wav|78|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p277/p277_194.wav|89|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p241/p241_177.wav|86|The clarity is vital.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p247/p247_275.wav|14|What form did that take ?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p230/p230_230.wav|35|That has been the easy part.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p323/p323_015.wav|34|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p269/p269_365.wav|94|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p310/p310_049.wav|17|They had four children together.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p281/p281_068.wav|36|I have proved that in the past.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p343/p343_162.wav|21|Dancing was her life.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p299/p299_208.wav|58|I'm a bit annoyed.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p329/p329_292.wav|103|The methadone programme is completely out of control.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p232/p232_376.wav|96|He could make it.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p305/p305_135.wav|54|I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p351/p351_231.wav|33|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p265/p265_153.wav|73|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p323/p323_137.wav|34|Everything was a dead end.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p305/p305_176.wav|54|That has given me great confidence.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p238/p238_053.wav|37|Does it matter ?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p230/p230_195.wav|35|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p238/p238_093.wav|37|He seems to have everything.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p259/p259_323.wav|7|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p285/p285_032.wav|2|This is the window.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p302/p302_208.wav|30|Which means it matters.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p231/p231_176.wav|50|This much I can tell you.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p301/p301_054.wav|91|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p310/p310_102.wav|17|We shall rely on human beings.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p305/p305_121.wav|54|It is a vicious circle.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p231/p231_458.wav|50|She has reached the top of her profession.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p311/p311_024.wav|4|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p245/p245_248.wav|59|Is there on his hands?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p333/p333_311.wav|64|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p299/p299_007.wav|58|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p229/p229_333.wav|67|She did not attend the courtroom.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p307/p307_286.wav|22|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p305/p305_414.wav|54|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p264/p264_140.wav|65|He nearly killed my son.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p374/p374_114.wav|11|I don't think it would make any difference.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p363/p363_369.wav|6|We have been overwhelmed by the response.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p293/p293_374.wav|23|I don't think the referees are against us.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p316/p316_329.wav|85|It's a production company.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p236/p236_018.wav|75|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p234/p234_332.wav|3|But it can be done.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p277/p277_132.wav|89|No production was achieved.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p326/p326_205.wav|28|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p272/p272_134.wav|69|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p316/p316_125.wav|85|And now the pressure is off.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p274/p274_149.wav|32|I prefer the clarity of the existing system.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p227/p227_368.wav|29|A crucial moment has arrived.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p334/p334_206.wav|38|We'll have to work hard today.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p339/p339_087.wav|18|I am not completely insane.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p286/p286_453.wav|63|He was said to be emotionally disturbed.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p301/p301_110.wav|91|People want to see me on the screen.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p282/p282_188.wav|83|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p263/p263_147.wav|39|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p256/p256_253.wav|90|I was never going to play against Scotland.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p374/p374_165.wav|11|Something has got to change.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p262/p262_232.wav|45|It's very safe.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p267/p267_417.wav|0|This is no reflection on Rangers.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p240/p240_078.wav|93|I've got the shirt.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p347/p347_143.wav|46|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p245/p245_069.wav|59|She died in hospital two hours later.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p233/p233_172.wav|84|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p280/p280_282.wav|52|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p298/p298_364.wav|68|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p339/p339_240.wav|18|The teacher would have approved.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p361/p361_387.wav|79|We have been going for three years.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p278/p278_221.wav|10|January is a bad time of year.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p334/p334_289.wav|38|They married in August last year.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p250/p250_187.wav|24|This championship is different from the other majors.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p248/p248_283.wav|99|Maloney is an engaging talent.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p275/p275_261.wav|40|It will be done in stages.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p288/p288_024.wav|47|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p271/p271_454.wav|27|It's a miracle.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p252/p252_408.wav|55|They had to have hospital treatment.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p261/p261_192.wav|100|It was a pre-emptive strike.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p308/p308_099.wav|107|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p288/p288_070.wav|47|Neither it is.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p317/p317_356.wav|97|We're not an employment agency.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p351/p351_251.wav|33|That is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p329/p329_075.wav|103|This will be no easy option.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p261/p261_180.wav|100|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p301/p301_272.wav|91|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p277/p277_404.wav|89|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p301/p301_135.wav|91|How good is Lennox Lewis?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p246/p246_333.wav|5|Two people were interviewed.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p340/p340_250.wav|74|The film was great.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p268/p268_355.wav|87|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p236/p236_143.wav|75|The whole industry is a shambles.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p231/p231_398.wav|50|They have failed to deliver.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p340/p340_322.wav|74|I am extremely cautious.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p228/p228_048.wav|57|The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p334/p334_193.wav|38|It is in our own hands.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p226/p226_128.wav|43|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p279/p279_064.wav|25|We have not given up hope.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p304/p304_416.wav|72|He took over our lives.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p313/p313_119.wav|76|O Neill is reputed to have replied.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p287/p287_195.wav|77|It comes from reflection or thinking.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p234/p234_008.wav|3|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p277/p277_119.wav|89|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p281/p281_394.wav|36|What are they for ?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p287/p287_272.wav|77|And they were being paid ?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p288/p288_071.wav|47|He seemed to lose his focus.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p335/p335_245.wav|49|A friendship that will endure.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p239/p239_061.wav|48|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p254/p254_003.wav|41|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p259/p259_282.wav|7|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p253/p253_202.wav|70|Sadly, it can't.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p318/p318_333.wav|19|But when we do it is great.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p351/p351_363.wav|33|You will never forget the clutching horror.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p241/p241_374.wav|86|There is no signature.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p272/p272_216.wav|69|The report is due out next month.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p330/p330_355.wav|1|I've got my own ideas.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p270/p270_179.wav|8|The outcome is now in our own hands.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p257/p257_079.wav|105|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p257/p257_027.wav|105|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p279/p279_118.wav|25|Does this mean.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p334/p334_058.wav|38|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p363/p363_178.wav|6|That was a huge experience.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p376/p376_227.wav|71|"And thought we would get away with it."
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p330/p330_411.wav|1|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p326/p326_316.wav|28|It certainly sounded it at times.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p323/p323_048.wav|34|Mackie was at home, unable to watch.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p313/p313_422.wav|76|Now, that is a good deal.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p364/p364_113.wav|88|It was just great.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p286/p286_414.wav|63|It's just a training thing.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p288/p288_229.wav|47|However, no further action was taken by police.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p259/p259_142.wav|7|What happened in that game ?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p297/p297_118.wav|42|It's too big a risk to take.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p313/p313_209.wav|76|The night is young.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p303/p303_279.wav|44|I bought a car at auction.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p345/p345_166.wav|82|Miller was every bit as happy.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p333/p333_289.wav|64|It's going to be quite a challenge.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p336/p336_323.wav|98|One paper was not returned.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p271/p271_082.wav|27|He is in the queue.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p314/p314_175.wav|51|There is no substitute.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p248/p248_124.wav|99|I can't even get into the A team.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p297/p297_160.wav|42|Tax is a matter for national governments.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p236/p236_299.wav|75|how do you get it back ?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p248/p248_300.wav|99|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p231/p231_429.wav|50|He is on the wrong side.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p250/p250_368.wav|24|We put our bid in last night.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p376/p376_191.wav|71|"I am totally surprised."
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p250/p250_419.wav|24|She started to put on weight.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p239/p239_037.wav|48|He works at the airport.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p340/p340_165.wav|74|He was very fit.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p339/p339_258.wav|18|There are not too many like him.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p326/p326_266.wav|28|It may also be her last.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p231/p231_472.wav|50|He felt it was the right time.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p261/p261_411.wav|100|I had a fortunate war.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p272/p272_359.wav|69|Now, though, he has an incentive.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p340/p340_015.wav|74|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p283/p283_022.wav|95|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p281/p281_334.wav|36|However, the groups denied the claims.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p318/p318_223.wav|19|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p281/p281_039.wav|36|This film will be totally awesome.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p270/p270_013.wav|8|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p243/p243_047.wav|53|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p374/p374_122.wav|11|The course is in great condition.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p302/p302_040.wav|30|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p254/p254_231.wav|41|And thought we would get away with it.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p246/p246_222.wav|5|It's not before time.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p262/p262_044.wav|45|It is difficult for Ali.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p270/p270_005.wav|8|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p274/p274_340.wav|32|This is a historic occasion.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p329/p329_045.wav|103|I hope you will leave it at that.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p285/p285_188.wav|2|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p260/p260_193.wav|81|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p259/p259_371.wav|7|He was unable to come.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p275/p275_052.wav|40|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p233/p233_159.wav|84|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p277/p277_312.wav|89|It will work.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p295/p295_211.wav|92|Leaving the Labour Party is one thing.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p297/p297_150.wav|42|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p305/p305_026.wav|54|He added, however, that all options are under review.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p292/p292_121.wav|13|This would not be my first choice.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p253/p253_346.wav|70|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p363/p363_171.wav|6|He didn't know where to look.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p233/p233_128.wav|84|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p251/p251_137.wav|9|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p334/p334_034.wav|38|Appointed general secretary last September.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p286/p286_225.wav|63|This will take several weeks.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p363/p363_183.wav|6|Public safety is paramount.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p256/p256_207.wav|90|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p273/p273_311.wav|56|Job losses were also announced.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p274/p274_425.wav|32|The projections are very positive for South Africa.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p254/p254_065.wav|41|That's the day job.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p335/p335_123.wav|49|Wagner was never like this.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p258/p258_105.wav|26|We do not expect any surplus.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p286/p286_294.wav|63|It was an easy decision to come here.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p361/p361_218.wav|79|But we were wrong.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p247/p247_426.wav|14|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p266/p266_391.wav|20|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p253/p253_116.wav|70|It is so sad.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p261/p261_081.wav|100|Our mother is very worried.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p268/p268_131.wav|87|But then they scored their fourth.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p229/p229_192.wav|67|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p275/p275_260.wav|40|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p313/p313_109.wav|76|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p347/p347_072.wav|46|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p298/p298_334.wav|68|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p271/p271_232.wav|27|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p283/p283_056.wav|95|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p255/p255_239.wav|31|It's the same as Glasgow.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p267/p267_244.wav|0|We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p340/p340_403.wav|74|I had a ball today.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p230/p230_083.wav|35|It might change your life.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p299/p299_403.wav|58|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p343/p343_128.wav|21|Then came the crunch.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p297/p297_021.wav|42|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p298/p298_275.wav|68|There are lots of these women in Finland.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p347/p347_286.wav|46|It is just too long since the war.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p239/p239_445.wav|48|Either group is living in fantasy land.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p286/p286_003.wav|63|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p299/p299_082.wav|58|I still feel like a wee boy.
