/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p299/p299_303.wav|26|No decision on that was taken.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p361/p361_165.wav|56|He tells the truth and that's important.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p226/p226_152.wav|52|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.

/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p228/p228_188.wav|65|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p238/p238_283.wav|4|Phase one was a shambles.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p286/p286_393.wav|3|How do you take them away?

/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p228/p228_143.wav|65|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p314/p314_398.wav|43|The conclusion is enthralling.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p260/p260_231.wav|31|But it's a subtle process.

/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p275/p275_192.wav|2|It is a farce.

/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p363/p363_247.wav|60|We are taking no chances this time.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p295/p295_055.wav|72|Such debate is pointless.

/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs/p281/p281_396.wav|32|Do they think anyone else wants them?
