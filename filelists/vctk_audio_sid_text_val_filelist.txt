/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p364/p364_298.wav|67|It's going to be tough.

/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p302/p302_188.wav|92|I'm really proud of my young players.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p254/p254_181.wav|87|I was totally wrong.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p276/p276_108.wav|77|People had been talking about a fourth quarter rally.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p313/p313_304.wav|41|I'm not a fan of books.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p240/p240_185.wav|71|We want to help them through it.

/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p252/p252_319.wav|12|One finding emerged clearly.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p245/p245_224.wav|15|It is not the message alone.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/s5/s5_101.wav|53|Some young girls also came by last night.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p376/p376_237.wav|83|Here we go again.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p301/p301_085.wav|16|I knew he would play two weeks ago.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p269/p269_264.wav|9|It is also very valuable.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p347/p347_363.wav|98|His silence on the issue is interesting.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p363/p363_377.wav|60|It is a memorial.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p286/p286_115.wav|3|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p330/p330_384.wav|66|So people will come out with these things.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p263/p263_129.wav|108|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p239/p239_144.wav|96|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p284/p284_317.wav|104|The Premier League has been a huge success.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p241/p241_132.wav|34|What will happen then?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p285/p285_393.wav|101|But we are a young side.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p347/p347_215.wav|98|That was moving the goalposts.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p302/p302_120.wav|92|Britain may now be forced to listen.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p299/p299_387.wav|26|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.

/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p255/p255_204.wav|23|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p335/p335_287.wav|95|Others were even less confident.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p258/p258_076.wav|59|I first met him last summer.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p270/p270_001.wav|44|Please call Stella.  
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p237/p237_122.wav|30|It is a delight on every level.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p305/p305_389.wav|80|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p292/p292_016.wav|17|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p376/p376_321.wav|83|It is just not working.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p234/p234_345.wav|79|However, the devil is in the detail.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p361/p361_156.wav|56|The driver just insulted me.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p323/p323_175.wav|51|We have done a deal with IMPACT.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p234/p234_020.wav|79|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p343/p343_133.wav|75|The referee had a shocking game.

/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p341/p341_265.wav|1|I gave him a way out, and he took it.

/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p329/p329_150.wav|76|And really, the songs are the key thing.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p316/p316_171.wav|28|We were hopeful that it would be successful.

/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p317/p317_060.wav|84|The problem is the book.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p312/p312_048.wav|35|The group will report back in the summer.

/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p288/p288_389.wav|42|It's just outrageous.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p335/p335_408.wav|95|There is no going back.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p259/p259_269.wav|99|What form did that take?
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p330/p330_051.wav|66|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p334/p334_397.wav|54|Being captain of this club is fantastic.

/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p261/p261_175.wav|86|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p237/p237_093.wav|30|We must look forward.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p316/p316_033.wav|28|It is not for any other purpose.
/run/media/viblab/Markov2/Pras/Thesis/Database/VCTK/wavs_pruned/p330/p330_058.wav|66|I think they should have more respect.
